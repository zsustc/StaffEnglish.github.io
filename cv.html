    I am currently a research assistant in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech, a.k.a., SUSTC). I received my B.E. from Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, SUSTech in June, 2017.
    <br>
    <br>
    I have been looking for <b>oppotunities to pursue graduate study</b>. My <b>research interests</b>, generally speaking, are all techniques that can help with obtaining satisfying images, ranging from low/mid-level vision to computer graphics, with specific topics being image deblurring, noise reduction, image inpainting, image-image translation, illumination manipulation, portrait manipulation and more.
    <br>
    <br>
    While the above-mentioned areas are popular already, my <b>emphasis</b> would be at: 
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>a) photographer-usable (pixel-level accurate) image quality.</i>
    <br>
    Images generated by algorithms, even claimed superior, may seem unnatural sometimes. I believe further work done to regulate pixels from violating common sense would meet a wider range of application scenarios and revolutionarily boost creativity of artists.
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>b) content awareness.</i>
    <br>
    Failure cases happen when local features contain semantic difference, and details of images fail to be restored if corresponding meanings of the pixels are not considered. Therefore I am wondering if it letting the algorithm know the content can help, as this is how human perceives and avoids similar mistakes.
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>c) not-only-data-driven approach.</i>
    <br>
    Although data-driven deep learning methods have been proven powerful in vision tasks, I am not satisfied with simply (well, not that simple) manipulating with network structures and I am curious about the roles that can be played by fundamental graphics and vision methods, such as 3D structure modeling and illumination estimation.
    <br>
    <br>
    <i>d) modeling visual preferences.</i> 
    <br>
    Visual preferences of human, in my opinion, describe the ability of human noticing if one image is unnatural as well as how images are expected to be processed to meet (personal or general) aesthetic desires. Modeling visual preferences can help with designing algorithms to avoid visual flaws of the generated images, providing quantitative criteria to replace subjective visual evaluation for comparing algorithms and, most importantly, reaching a higher level of computer vision with ability of aesthetic appreciation.

    Rui Ma, Shuaijun Wang, Fangzhou Han, Qi Hao, Yi Yang<br>
    This project aims to build datasets with data gathered by buses and taxis to develop algorithms for autonomous driving and on-demand planning. The process also involves methods of self-annotation and cyber-physical training/test. Proposal of this project was chosen and funded with an amount of $600,000 by Intel’s University Research Office. <i>Personal contribution</i> includes investigating and illustrating plans to collect and annotate data in the proposal.

    Cheng Li, Shuaijun Wang, Fangzhou Han, Qi Hao, etc.<br>
    This project aims to develop an autonomous bus system in which number and routes of working buses depend on passengers’ demands instead of fixed bus stops. <i>Personal contribution</i> includes implementing face detection and registration algorithms to monitor passenger number and putting forward a draft of the detailed plan for developing softwares used by the bus system.

    Fangzhou Han, Gongjin Lan, Qi Hao<br>
    This project aims to develop an algorithm of robust low-resolution face recognition for UAV applications. <i>Personal contribution</i> includes modifying a partially-coupled neural network structure to learn from both high- and low-resolution face images, as well as building a simulation platform based on Unreal Engine. The simulation platform is uesd to generate 2D face images with different angles of view and illumination conditions from real and reconstructed 3D faces to feed the network, as well as to simulate multi-UAV planning while tracking targets.

    <td><p><strong>[Bachelor Graduation Project] Restoration of Single Image under Complicated Illumination Conditions [completed]</strong><br>
    This project proposed a method to restore images from shadows and light spots referring to illumination condition. The illumination condition was estimated by observing sky, shadows of vertical objects and lightness gradients of vertical surfaces. Hard and soft shadows were then removed respectively using paired-region classification and soft matting, and light spots were handled in a similar way by considering them as “negative shadows” and then optimizing the parameters.
